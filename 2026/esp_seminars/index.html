    <td colspan="3">Recent developments in energy engineering and state-of-the art technologies to increase eco-friendly energy production are receiving increasing attention in scientific debate as engines of growth. Although the energy-growth-environment nexus has been extensively studied, the ecological implications of innovative technologies in energy production are yet to be adequately addressed to provide adhoc social changes and policy perspectives. To bridge these gaps, the present study investigates the relationship between energy innovation (EIN), renewable energy production (REP), non-renewable energy production (NREP), energy intensity (EI), research and development (R&D) expenditures, GDP, and ecological footprint (EF) in 21 OECD economies during the period 1990–2018. This study applies advanced, rigorous, and robust econometric methodologies. The empirical outcomes reveal that REP, EIN, and EI, mitigate EF, while NREP, GDP, and R&D somehow accelerate the ecological deficit. This study advances the empirically proven validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis for OECD countries and provides valuable policy insights in terms of intensification of governmental budget spending on R&D, and boosting technological energy innovations and non-polluting energy projects. Of particular importance to trace a green energy growth is the development of comprehensive economic and energy policies with a specific focus on ecological wellbeing.</td>

    <td colspan="3">The massive arrival of sargassum is generating environmental, social, and economic impacts on the Mexican coasts of the Caribbean Sea. This seaweed is transported by floating across the Atlantic Ocean under the combined effects of wind and surface ocean circulation. A diagnosis of the variability of atmospheric circulations in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea will be presented, identifying the conditions under which sargassum arrives on the coasts of Quintana Roo (Mexico), where the most popular tourist resort in the region is located: Cancun. Thirty years of surface wind data (1989 to 2018) from NCAR's CFRS (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) over the Atlantic and Caribbean were analyzed, dividing the region into six areas. For each area, its seasonal, annual and interannual variability was estimated, as well as its extreme values and its correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO). According to the results, atmospheric conditions for transporting sargassum to the coasts of Quintana Roo coasts are more favorable in summer than in winter. Additionally, the 90th percentile of surface wind in the Caribbean Sea favors sargassum transport in both winter and summer, however, “connectivity” with other regions (the central Atlantic) makes sargassum transport more favorable in summer, highlighting the role of the Caribbean low-level jet, which has two relative maxima: the first in February and the second in July. As case studies, atmospheric conditions were analyzed for two years identified as extreme: 2015 and 2018, for both summer and winter.</td>

    <td colspan="3">Some of the most important decisions about the future regarding climate and energy policy are decided on the basis of results from reduced complexity climate models (RCMs), which take emissions of pollutants and calculate global average temperature. RCMs are tuned from comprehensive Earth Systems Models (ESMs), but use very simple equations. They've also received relatively little scrutiny in the scientific literature. We study one particular RCM called "fair," which was used in recent IPCC reports to estimate the remaining carbon budget to keep warming under 1.5 or 2 C. Although fair is constrained to essentially exactly reproduce current CO2 concentrations, we show that it underestimates future CO2 concentrations significantly compared with the models to which it is tuned. We provide an explanation and discuss implications for RCM development and ESM experimental design. We additionally discuss how simple models can be used to allow students to simulate their own climate and energy futures, including those based in climate justice.</td>

<tr id="details-laurel" class="expandable-row">
    <td colspan="3">Prior work suggests that the 2020-2023 three-year long La Niña event was triggered by the combination of a strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) event that began in 2019 and a strong Atlantic Niño; however, it is unclear what caused the positive IOD event. This analysis suggests that cross-timescale interference between the IOD and Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) contributed to the generation of this positive IOD 
event, with interactions occurring in two stages. First, during late April 2019, strong winds associated with MJO phases 2 and 3, and the related formation of two twin tropical cyclones, produced downwelling Kelvin waves in the Indian Ocean that propagated to the western coast of Java and Sumatra and reflected to the west as downwelling Rossby waves, subsequently deepening the thermocline in the eastern basin, and impacting the IOD state. Subsequently, a second MJO phase 2 and 3 event created additional westward propagating downwelling Rossby waves that depressed the thermocline in the western basin, allowing for the progression of anomalous positive sea-surface temperature anomalies towards the west that triggered the strong positive IOD event. Based on these findings, and results from a linear wave model analysis, this study concludes that through cross-timescale interference, the MJO preconditioned the positive IOD state during the first MJO event and triggered the strong positive IOD event during the second MJO occurrence. These combined mechanisms acted as a catalyst contributing to the formation of the positive IOD event in 2019 that preceded the three-year long La Niña event.</td>
