        Mineral dust from arid regions is a major contributor to the global aerosol burden and a key source of uncertainty in weather and climate models due to its radiative effects. These effects, particularly in theshortwave, depend strongly on particle size and mineral composition, especially the presence of iron oxide–carrying minerals. Many global dust models assume fixed or homogeneous source mineralogy, often neglecting size-dependent variability. This is further complicated by uncertainties in source datasets and the computational cost of explicit composition modeling. We use the MONARCH (Multiscale Online Non-hydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry) model, coupled with RRTMG, to simulate global dust transport and radiative effects under different mineralogical assumptions. MONARCH resolves individual mineral tracers and uses the Maxwell-Garnett approach to compute optical properties of host particles with iron oxide inclusions. The set of numerical experiments covers varying mineralogy assumptions and a set of soil mineralogy atlases, including the new high-resolution EMIT product.

        Data-driven and hypothesis-driven models have coexisted in climate science for decades, with a predominant role for General Circulation Models. Recently, the exponential development of Artificial Intelligence has provided novel opportunities for data-driven techniques, typically with substantial benefits in terms of computational cost. In this seminar, I will discuss how the two families of models can be combined into hybrid architectures, and I will provide examples of prototypes of hybrid climate services in Europe and Africa.

        The Aedes aegypti mosquito, a known vector for dangerous arboviruses like yellow fever and dengue, is spreading, creating a significant public health risk for Cyprus and the wider Mediterranean. This species is currently found along the eastern Black Sea coast, in northeastern Turkey, and has recently been detected near Larnaca airport in Cyprus. To understand the potential for its spread, we adapted the VECTRI malaria model to predict Ae. aegypti's dynamics in Europe and Cyprus. Our simulations show that Larnaca, Limassol, Nicosia, Paphos, and Ayia Napa have ideal climates for the mosquito to take hold. Additionally, a R0 model, which aligns with historical dengue and yellow fever hotspots, forecasts a high risk of transmission in Cyprus, Greece, Crete, Turkey, southern Italy, and parts of Spain. To stop the re-establishment of Ae. aegypti in Europe, we urge strict mosquito surveillance at Greek ports and airports, as well as immediate eradication measures in Cyprus.

        Hydro-meteorological extremes are intensifying across West Africa due to changing climatic conditions and land use, posing significant challenges for water resources and flood risk management. In the Falémé Basin of Senegal, understanding the relationships between extreme rainfall and river discharge is critical for sustainable water management and disaster preparedness. This study investigates hydrological extremes and their links to rainfall using daily river discharge at the main outlet (Kidira) and basin-averaged daily rainfall (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data: CHIRPS), evapotranspiration and soil moisture (Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model: GLEAM) over the period 1981–2024. The analysis considers the distribution of rainfall and river flow, as well as standardized indices for rainfall (SPI) and streamflow (SRI). It also includes trend analysis of annual maxima using the Mann–Kendall test, computation of the 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles to characterize low, high, and exceptional flows, peak-over-threshold (POT) analysis, return level curves, lag correlations between rainfall and flow, and runoff coefficient estimation. Results indicate a similar distribution between rainfall and river flow, with wetter conditions during 2001–2024 compared to 1981–2000. Extreme rainfall and river discharge (99th percentile) increased by 12.6% and 71.8%, respectively. Positive trends were observed for annual maximum rainfall and river discharge throughout 1981–2024. Analysis of SPI and SRI revealed dry conditions during 1981–1995, mixed wet and dry conditions during 1996–2008, and consistently wetter conditions from 2009–2024. POT events above the 99th percentile indicate that high flows are generally preceded by extreme rainfall, with the last two decades exhibiting the highest number of such events, particularly in 2024 (up to 30 days). Return period analysis shows that exceptional high flows, capable of causing significant damage, have return periods of 60–70 years. Additionally, the runoff coefficient increased up to 60.7% between 1981–2000 and 2001–2024 due to higher rainfall intensities and land cover degradation. Moreover, the prediction of hydrological response using the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model reveals that it can accurately reproduce the key hydrological characteristics of the basin, with performance metrics: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), KlingGupta Efficiency (KGE), and Coefficient of Determination (R²) values greater than 0.9, and Percent Bias (PBIAS) less than 5%. This demonstrates the potential of data-driven modeling for flood forecasting, although the model struggles to simulate very high extreme river flows. This study highlights the importance of understanding the links between rainfall variability and extreme river flows, providing essential information for developing effective flood forecasting and early warning systems.

        The latest version of the ICTP intermediate complexity GCM is coupled to a thermodynamic ocean and sea-ice model, where specific forcing and regional relaxation terms account for the tendencies due to ocean and ice dynamics. With this modelling framework, it is possible to produce pacemaker experiments covering the recent historical period (1950-2020), aimed at investigating the atmospheric response to tropical SST anomalies and sea-ice variability. This talk will present results from pacemaker ensemble simulations with different specifications of CO2 radiative forcing and long-term sea-ice variability, looking at inter-decadal trends in a variety of global and hemispheric variables. In particular, we show how the NAO-like trend in the boreal wintertime circulation is affected by these two factors. Consistently with earlier studies, we show that the decrease in Arctic sea-ice cover counterbalances the effect of an increased upper-troposphere temperature gradient as far the NAO trend is concerned.

        The presence of phytoplankton in the ocean affects the vertical distribution of shortwave heating in the upper ocean, linking marine biology and ocean physics. Water with a high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) 
concentration, an indicator of phytoplankton abundance, traps more shortwave radiation in the upper layer, leading to surface warming and subsurface cooling. This effect is non-negligible in the upper-ocean heat budget and has therefore been incorporated into general circulation models. The coupling between marine biology and ocean physics influences both the ocean mean-state and its variability. In the tropics, regions with high chlorophyll-a concentrations (such as equatorial upwellings and eastern boundary upwelling systems) coincide with areas of strong interannual sea surface temperature variability. While past studies have 
mainly focused on the tropical Pacific and the potential effect of marine biology on El Niño, here we aim to examine this effect in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, where Atlantic Niños, Benguela Niños, and Dakar Niños occur. Additionally, while a decline in Chl-a concentration has been observed in the tropics over recent decades, Chl-a concentrations have increased at higher latitudes, potentially altering ocean 
circulation. To address these questions, sensitivity experiments are conducted using the NOAA-GFDL Modular Ocean Model version 5 (MOM5). In this preliminary phase, we compare a control run that includes a realistic seasonal cycle of Chl-a with a sensitivity experiment in which the seasonal Chl-a cycle is multiplied by a factor of 1.5.

        Clinical immunity against malaria - protection against severe symptoms - highly depends on the cumulative life history of exposure to the disease, which is in turn driven by the locally dominant vector species and its ecology. In areas with high endemicity, where individuals are exposed to frequent infectious bites, clinical immunity is acquired rapidly - typically before adolescence. This early acquisition translates however into a high incidence of severe disease especially affecting children under 5 years of age (Fig, red line). Conversely, in regions with a sporadic presence of the vector - often found in fringe zones like the Sahel - immunity is acquired slowlier, with a less pronounced peak in the incidence of severe disease during childhood, but with higher incidence rates later in a subject’s life (Fig, blue line). In regions with high inter-annual rainfall variability where the main malaria vector is the rain-driven anopheles gambiae s.l., the alternance between favourable (e.g., high rainfall) and unfavourable years might drive ‘fluctuations’ in the immunity profiles described before (Fig, discontinuous lines). These fluctuations might have varied effects depending on the endemicity level of a given location, this is, the type of immunity ‘curve’. In my ongoing work I aim to study the immunity-driven effect of inter-annual rainfall variability on malaria incidence in Senegal and The Gambia. I will present a novel regional-scale agent-based model of human health able to resolve age- and climate-dependent immunity profiles against clinical malaria and how this can be calibrated to accurately represent the region under scope. Numerical experiments and preliminary runs are discussed.

        Glaciers are retreating worldwide due to rising temperatures, with Alpine glaciers showing rapid decline. This study focuses on the Monte Rosa region, where satellite imagery and modeling were used to estimate Snow Line Altitude (SLA) and Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA). K-means clustering proved more accurate than Otsu segmentation, and results were validated on the Caresser and Schwarzberg glaciers. Using the Open Global
Glacier Model (OGGM) with high-resolution climate data, we found strong agreement with observations. Projections show glaciers may lose up to 95% of their volume by 2100 under high emissions, with ELAs rising above 4200 meters. A tipping point occurs around 3550 meters, beyond which glacier loss becomes irreversible.

        Attribution of a flood event: a case study of the April/May 2024 floods in Southern Brazil

        The flood event of April/May 2024 that hit the Southernmost State of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, broke local records, with rivers reaching their highest level in recorded history. Around 2.4 million people are estimated to have been affected by the flood, with hundreds of thousands displaced and/or without access to potable water and electricity in their homes. Extreme precipitation, linked to a negative surface pressure anomaly, as suggested in the ERA5 dataset, was the primary driver. 
While attributing extreme precipitation events is an established practice, less work has been done to directly attribute river flood events to climate change, often due to a lack of long-term data in the region of interest. This study explores the feasibility of employing the existing attribution framework for attributing extreme discharge events.
We analyzed daily precipitation and river discharge data from over 40 stations (1960–2023, <10% missing) using two approaches. First, a "factual" distribution was developed using all the data available. A “counterfactual” distribution was obtained by fitting a distribution with the global mean surface temperature as covariate and a constant dispersion parameter, and then deriving the distribution assuming a 1.2°C cooler world.  Second, the data was divided into two separate periods: 1960-1991 (“past”) and 1992-2023 (“present”). In both cases, differences in extreme values between these distributions were statistically assessed. Additionally, the surface pressure anomaly in ERA5 was used for analog attribution study, to assess the significance of the changes in surface pressure, precipitation, temperature, and discharge fields, between the “past” and “present” time periods.
Hydrological simulations performed with the CETEMPS Hydrological Model (CHyM) coupled with the CORDEX (Coordinated Downscaling Experiment)-CORE models output, both for a historical period and under the rcp85 scenario, were also used. The model validation done for the historical period, comparing CHyM outputs against discharge station data, showed quite good agreement between the two for several statistics. Both the hydrological simulations and the regional climate CORDEX-CORE simulations were used in the analog attribution study to confirm the attribution of the event to global warming. This analysis investigates the potential of integrating hydrological modeling and observational discharge data to advance the attribution of extreme flood events to climate change.

        In this talk I will introduce the fundamentals of the information-theory-based causality metric introduced by Liang and Kleeman, and will showcase how it can be used to help identify sources of predictability (both in observations and models). Finally, I will discuss causal-based crosstime-scale bridging, a proposed method to identify if and when it is possible to "bridge" (or merge) predictions across timescales.
