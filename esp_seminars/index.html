        Mineral dust from arid regions is a major contributor to the global aerosol burden and a key source of uncertainty in weather and climate models due to its radiative effects. These effects, particularly in theshortwave, depend strongly on particle size and mineral composition, especially the presence of iron oxide–carrying minerals. Many global dust models assume fixed or homogeneous source mineralogy, often neglecting size-dependent variability. This is further complicated by uncertainties in source datasets and the computational cost of explicit composition modeling. We use the MONARCH (Multiscale Online Non-hydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry) model, coupled with RRTMG, to simulate global dust transport and radiative effects under different mineralogical assumptions. MONARCH resolves individual mineral tracers and uses the Maxwell-Garnett approach to compute optical properties of host particles with iron oxide inclusions. The set of numerical experiments covers varying mineralogy assumptions and a set of soil mineralogy atlases, including the new high-resolution EMIT product.

        Data-driven and hypothesis-driven models have coexisted in climate science for decades, with a predominant role for General Circulation Models. Recently, the exponential development of Artificial Intelligence has provided novel opportunities for data-driven techniques, typically with substantial benefits in terms of computational cost. In this seminar, I will discuss how the two families of models can be combined into hybrid architectures, and I will provide examples of prototypes of hybrid climate services in Europe and Africa.

        The Aedes aegypti mosquito, a known vector for dangerous arboviruses like
yellow fever and dengue, is spreading, creating a significant public
health risk for Cyprus and the wider Mediterranean. This species is
currently found along the eastern Black Sea coast, in northeastern Turkey,
and has recently been detected near Larnaca airport in Cyprus. To
understand the potential for its spread, we adapted the VECTRI malaria
model to predict Ae. aegypti's dynamics in Europe and Cyprus. Our
simulations show that Larnaca, Limassol, Nicosia, Paphos, and Ayia Napa
have ideal climates for the mosquito to take hold. Additionally, a
R0 model, which aligns with historical dengue and yellow fever
hotspots, forecasts a high risk of transmission in Cyprus, Greece, Crete,
Turkey, southern Italy, and parts of Spain. To stop the re-establishment
of Ae. aegypti in Europe, we urge strict mosquito surveillance at Greek
ports and airports, as well as immediate eradication measures in Cyprus.

        Investigating rainfall–river flow extremes and predicting hydrological response using LSTM model in the Falémé Basin, Senegal

        Hydro-meteorological extremes are intensifying across West Africa due to changing climatic
conditions and land use, posing significant challenges for water resources and flood risk
management. In the Falémé Basin of Senegal, understanding the relationships between extreme
rainfall and river discharge is critical for sustainable water management and disaster preparedness.
This study investigates hydrological extremes and their links to rainfall using daily river discharge
at the main outlet (Kidira) and basin-averaged daily rainfall (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
Precipitation with Station data: CHIRPS), evapotranspiration and soil moisture (Global Land
Evaporation Amsterdam Model: GLEAM) over the period 1981–2024. The analysis considers the
distribution of rainfall and river flow, as well as standardized indices for rainfall (SPI) and
streamflow (SRI). It also includes trend analysis of annual maxima using the Mann–Kendall test,
computation of the 5th, 95th, and 99th percentiles to characterize low, high, and exceptional flows,
peak-over-threshold (POT) analysis, return level curves, lag correlations between rainfall and flow,
and runoff coefficient estimation.
Results indicate a similar distribution between rainfall and river flow, with wetter conditions during
2001–2024 compared to 1981–2000. Extreme rainfall and river discharge (99th percentile)
increased by 12.6% and 71.8%, respectively. Positive trends were observed for annual maximum
rainfall and river discharge throughout 1981–2024. Analysis of SPI and SRI revealed dry conditions
during 1981–1995, mixed wet and dry conditions during 1996–2008, and consistently wetter
conditions from 2009–2024.
POT events above the 99th percentile indicate that high flows are generally preceded by extreme
rainfall, with the last two decades exhibiting the highest number of such events, particularly in 2024
(up to 30 days). Return period analysis shows that exceptional high flows, capable of causing
significant damage, have return periods of 60–70 years. Additionally, the runoff coefficient
increased up to 60.7% between 1981–2000 and 2001–2024 due to higher rainfall intensities and
land cover degradation. Moreover, the prediction of hydrological response using the LSTM (Long
Short-Term Memory) model reveals that it can accurately reproduce the key hydrological
characteristics of the basin, with performance metrics: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), 
KlingGupta Efficiency (KGE), and Coefficient of Determination (R²) values greater than 0.9, and Percent
Bias (PBIAS) less than 5%. This demonstrates the potential of data-driven modeling for flood
forecasting, although the model struggles to simulate very high extreme river flows.
This study highlights the importance of understanding the links between rainfall variability and
extreme river flows, providing essential information for developing effective flood forecasting and
early warning systems.

        Glaciers are retreating worldwide due to rising temperatures, with Alpine
glaciers showing rapid decline. This study focuses on the Monte Rosa
region, where satellite imagery and modeling were used to estimate Snow
Line Altitude (SLA) and Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA). K-means
clustering proved more accurate than Otsu segmentation, and results were
validated on the Caresser and Schwarzberg glaciers. Using the Open Global
Glacier Model (OGGM) with high-resolution climate data, we found strong
agreement with observations. Projections show glaciers may lose up to 95%
of their volume by 2100 under high emissions, with ELAs rising above 4200
meters. A tipping point occurs around 3550 meters, beyond which glacier
loss becomes irreversible.
